# This is an example of a parameters file
# It is written according to the YAML-convention (www.yaml.org) and is checked by the code for consistency.
# Three types of parameters are possible and reflected in the structure of the document:
#
# Parameter category:
#   Setting Name: <value>
#
# The three parameter categories are:
# - setting: Setting to use for preprocessing and class specific settings. if no <value> is specified, the value for
#   this setting is set to None.
# - featureClass: Feature class to enable, <value> is list of strings representing enabled features. If no <value> is
#   specified or <value> is an empty list ('[]'), all features for this class are enabled.
# - imageType: image types to calculate features on. <value> is custom kwarg settings (dictionary). if <value> is an
#   empty dictionary ('{}'), no custom settings are added for this input image.
#
# Some parameters have a limited list of possible values. Where this is the case, possible values are listed in the
# package documentation

# Settings to use, possible settings are listed in the documentation (section "Customizing the extraction").
setting:
  label: 1
  # resampledPixelSpacing: None # This disables resampling, as it is interpreted as None, to enable it, specify spacing in x, y, z as [x, y , z]
  # weightingNorm: None # If no value is specified, it is interpreted as None
  binWidth: 0.25
  # Normalization:
  # MR signal is usually relative, with large differences between scanners and vendors. By normalizing the image before
  # feature calculation, this confounding effect may be reduced. However, if only one specific scanner is used, or the
  # images reflect some absolute world value (e.g. ADC maps, T2maps (NOT T2 weighted)), consider disabling the
  # normalization.
  # normalize: true
  # normalizeScale: 100  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

  # Resampling:
  # Not enabled in this example. However, because texture calculation assumes isotropic spacing, a forced 2D extraction
  # is used, therefore only requiring the voxels to be isotropic in-plane. Enable pre-cropping to reduce memory
  # footprint and speed up applying the filters.
  # preCrop: true

  # Forced 2D extracion:
  # This allows to calculate texture features using anisotropic voxels (although it assumes that voxels are isotropic
  # in-plane). This is an alternative to resampling the image to isotropic voxels.
  # force2D: true
  # force2Ddimension: 0  # axial slices, for coronal slices, use dimension 1 and for sagittal, dimension 2.

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50

  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  # binWidth: 5

  # first order specific settings:
  # When normalizing, gray values below the mean will be negative. Shifting by 300 (3 StdDevs * 100) ensures that the
  # majority of voxels is positive (only outliers >3 SD lower than the mean will be negative).
  # voxelArrayShift: 300

  # Misc:
  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
  # or in a column "Label" in the input csv (batchprocessing)
